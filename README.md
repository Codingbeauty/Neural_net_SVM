# Neural Network and SVM from scratch in Python
In this project we have created two python class.

One for Neural Network and one for SVM.

Neural Network class includes methods for both binary-classification and multiclass classification.

SVM includes methods for only binary classification.

#####################################################

Neural_Network.py contains all the methods for NN classification.

Usage of NN classifier is given in Neural_network_iris.py where it is applied on iris data set of sci-kit learn

######################################################

svm_with_kernel.py contains SVM implementaion with kernels like RBF and Poly.

example of its usage is contained in the same file
